## CNN Model

The aim of this project is to develop two CNN models to detect five classes from the cifar-10 dataset. The first model acts as a baseline which includes Conv2D, Dense and MaxPooling2D layers. The second model works on increasing the accuracy of the baseline model by using dropouts and transfer learning methods
